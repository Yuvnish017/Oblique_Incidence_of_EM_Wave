# Simulating_Oblique_Incidence_of_EM_Wave
In this project we tried to plot the total electric field and total electric field in a medium after the uniform plane wave is incident at a conducting plate.
Here we assumed that the uniform plane wave is y-polarized and simulated the total electic field(Incident Electric Field + Reflected Wave) and total magnetic field in the medium
after incidence. We used MATLAB 2020a for plotting. An application is also created using MATLAB App Designer for the same.
